## Recognition of the American Sign Language Alphabet using Deep Learning


### Abstract
This  project presents training a deep learning model to correctly classify the gestures of the American sign language alphabet. Image classification is a common problem approached by the fields of computer vision and machine learning. The main goal of the project was to classify every image in the dataset using neural networks. A conventional neural network is baseline of this investigation, followed by the use of a convolution neural network (CNN) and data augmentation techniques. The final model configuration included augmented data which boosted the validation accuracy to 98.56% and the training accuracy to 99.14%. This result showed that the configuration proposed performed better and reduced overfitting.


## Setup
To run this project, use Anaconda or Google Colab.
